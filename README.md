## Week 2 Homework Activity (See Moodle for all Homework)

Add a link below to a learning resource that's helped you so far and say why you're linking it. Resources must be unique so the faster you are the easier it'll be for you.

e.g.

[PyMOTW](https://pymotw.com/3/) - Python Module Of The Week. A list of built-in Python modules and how to use them. Maybe be a bit advanced for some students right now (week 2) but you'll find it useful by the time you finish the semester. - Kris



Add yours here.

https://www.python.org/ - official website of the Python project. 
https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008  - This link refers to the PEP(Python Enhancement Proposals). It is very important to read to make very good consistent code and following coding standards.
https://realpython.com/ - good and well described Python courses and tutorials. 

[Nik Ledogorov: LinkedIn - Advance Your Skills In Python](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/paths/advance-your-skills-in-python) - this is only 1 month free trial but is decent.

https://www.w3schools.com/python/default.asp Python Tutorial  (not just about Python but many other langranges as well)

[Kirill: Offical Python Tutorial](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/) - Found this as a good overview of Python and useful reference when coding.

[David D: LinkedIn - Learning Cryptography and Network Security](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/learning-cryptography-and-network-security) - doing this at the moment to support my cryptography studies. Very good as an overview to get a head start on what we can expect in this course for those of us that like a flipped classroom. :)

Jag: somethings that helped me when I was doing my computer science degree at University of Auckland.
[Jag: Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/) - beest interactive way to learn python and caters for all levels.
[Jag's GDrive link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1qfa7k-2rxZ_Or80MykGOhMaCU_rFfGO3?usp=sharing) - this drive has all the basics of python and honestly if you binge watch them like we all do for netflix you will ace python this saved me in my degree.
