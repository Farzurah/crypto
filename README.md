## Week 2 Homework Activity (See Moodle for all Homework)

Add a link below to a learning resource that's helped you so far and say why you're linking it. Resources must be unique so the faster you are the easier it'll be for you.

e.g.

[PyMOTW](https://pymotw.com/3/) - Python Module Of The Week. A list of built-in Python modules and how to use them. Maybe be a bit advanced for some students right now (week 2) but you'll find it useful by the time you finish the semester. - Kris
